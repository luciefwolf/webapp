Note for C4ADS:

Since the previous code I've written for the Daniel Lab, and the code that I wrote working on Abstractivist, are both 
no longer accessable to me, I have submitted this work that a partner and I spent several weeks on for the Software 
Design course I took in Fall of 2022. 

Some of the files and portions of the website (particularly the "Help" section of the navigation bar) may be a bit off, 
and that is because of how the professor requested it be done. Additionally, unfortunately, the database we used 
unfortunately is not part of the github because it is too large. I am happy to send pictures or videos of the fully-
functioning website if that would be helpful; please let me know if there's anything I can do.

Once again, I'm very excited at this opportunity, and thank you for your considering.
